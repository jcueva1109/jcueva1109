# Hello There! :waving_hand_medium_skin_tone:

<p align="justify"> My name is Jesus Cueva and I'm a software developer. I'm from :honduras: currently as a freelancer and trying to learn everything I can. 
<br>
I'm a Front End/Back End Developer, Content Creator and Entrepeneur. I'm also currently doing my Bsc in Computer Science while working on my personal projects. I am passionate about AI, Machine Learning, Dynamic Programming, UX/UI, Blogging, Logging and Automation. When I'm not developing and building things, you can find me on Youtube learning, writing an article, watching movies, daydreaming actionpacked dreams where I am the MC or on my laptop gaming. But most of my days are spent working on projects while listening to beat coding, studying, or watching movies. </p>

### Blog :writing_hand_medium_skin_tone:
Apart of coding, I also maintain a blog - you can find my articles on my website [Advanced Tech](https://jesuscueva100.wixsite.com/advtech "Advanced Tech Blog"). Also you can stop by and see my [Quora profile](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jes√πs-Cueva "jcueva0911 on quora").
