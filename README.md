# Hello There! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

<p align="justify"> My name is Jesus Cueva and I'm a software developer. I'm from :honduras: currently as a freelancer and trying to learn everything I can. 
<br>
I'm a Front End/Back End Developer, Content Creator and Entrepeneur. I'm also currently doing my Bsc in Computer Science while working on my personal projects. I am passionate about AI, Machine Learning, Dynamic Programming, UX/UI, Blogging, Logging and Automation. When I'm not developing and building things, you can find me on Youtube learning, writing an article, watching movies, daydreaming actionpacked dreams where I am the MC or on my laptop gaming. But most of my days are spent working on projects while listening to beat coding, studying, or watching movies. </p>
